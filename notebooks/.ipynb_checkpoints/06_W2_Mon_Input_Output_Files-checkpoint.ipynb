This chapter presents the following ways to work with external data:\n",

    "On some systems (typically the Windows operating system), you might have gotten an **encoding error**. These errors are very common but unfortunately rather nasty. As you will know, computers can only store information as binary \"bits\" at the rawest level. To store an alphabetical character, for instance, we'll need to know how we can translate the character symbol to a series of bits (and vice versa). While this will be covered in greater detail in the \"Text as data\" module, a character encoding does exactly that. **Unicode** is the most common, most inclusive and most widely supported encoding standard in the world nowadays. **UTF-8** is a common subset of Unicode that is the default in the Python ecosystem. However, it could be that UTF-8 is not the default encoding on your specific computer and in this case, you have to make clear to Python that you're using a deviant encoding.\n",
