    "## 1. What are Regular Expressions?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Very general definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regular expressions** are used to formalize patterns in character sequences. Any given character sequence (=any string) can be tested against a regular expression. If the pattern occurs in the string, we call this a **match**. In other words: **Regular expressions are used for pattern matching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common use cases is the validation of input strings on web forms, e.g., to test if users entered a properly formatted e-mail address or birth date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A more scientific definition:\n",
    "\"**Pattern matching** consists in finding a section of text that is\n",
    "described (matched) by a regular expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **regular expression** is a string containing a combination of normal characters and special metacharacters or metasequences. The normal characters match themselves.\n",
    "**Metacharacters** and metasequences are characters or sequences of characters that represent ideas such as quantity, locations, or types of characters.\"\n",

This means that the pattern is already translated into CPU instructions (imagine it like zeros and ones that the CPU can work with). When a pre-compiled pattern is used in the code, e.g., in a for- or while-loop, the Python interpreter does not need to compile it in every iteration of the loop and therefore saves time. In other words: matching against a compiled pattern takes the CPU less time and increases the runtime significantly. \n",
