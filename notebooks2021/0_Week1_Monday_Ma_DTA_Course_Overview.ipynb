    "Jupyter notebooks are based on the idea of a [narrative](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/use-cases/narrative-notebook.html) or telling a story. Much like a scientists notebook which contains data observations alongside analytic narrative, the Jupyter Notebook offers a way for writing text interspersed with Python code. The narrative and code are assembled underneath the hood using HTML and Javascript. You shouldn't need to worry about this, but it is good to know what's going on. \n",

The link there contains a cheatsheet about how to write pretty text in markdown. You can do things like add **bolded text** by wrapping text with double asterix: `**your text here**`. Or you can indicate headings with a hashtag: `# A Primary Heading` or `## A Secondary Heading`. \n",
