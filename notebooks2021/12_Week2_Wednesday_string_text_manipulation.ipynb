    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "As we learned before, strings are a *data type* (other data types we looked at: `bool`, `int`, `float`, `tuple`, `list`, `dict`, ...). In this session we will learn how to manipulate strings by looking at two of their main characteristics: (1) Strings are ordered sequences of characters and (2) strings are so-called objects. The latter will be explained in detail only in week 3. However, we can already attempt to understand what it means in practice today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Strings as Sequences / Sequence Operations on Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings are a sequential data type. A string is an ordered sequence of characters. We can use this characteristic to manipulate strings with **sequence operations**, some of which we have already used in previous sessions. For example, we can add strings together or multiply them. The most important sequence operations will be introduced here:\n",

    "### 2.1 Concatenating strings with `+`\n",
    "When applied to numbers (integer or float) the plus operator (`+`) processes a mathematical addition. When used on strings, the `+` operator concatenates two or more strings into a new one."
